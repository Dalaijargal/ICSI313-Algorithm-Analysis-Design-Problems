They are downloaded from Stanford Network Analysis Platform [1]. We converted directed networks to be undirected, remapped the node indexes (from 0 to n-1), and formatted the networks. 

Network format:
The format is similar to the adjacency list representation of graphs.
There are n+1 lines, where n is the number of nodes.
The first line contains the number of nodes. In the following n lines, each line includes a node and its neighbors: a node ID followed by a colon and the list of its neighbor nodes' ID.
